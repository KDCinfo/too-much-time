                  Too-Much-Time is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Active" target="kdcNewWinExt">Chromium-based browser</a>
                  extension<sup>*</sup> that allows you to "time" the time you spend on certain websites.
                  When the time you specify is up, you'll get an alert offering you the opportunity to stop or snooze.
                </p>

                <p><u>Situational Examples:</u></p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>- If you find you've been spending a little more time than you would prefer on your favorite social networking site.</li>
                    <li>- Or perhaps you'd like to time your shopping on your favorite eCommerce site.</li>
                    <li>- Perhaps you'd like to time your efforts spent researching through an informational site.</li>
                    <li>- Or put in 'just enough' reading on a particular reading site before bed.</li>
                  </ul>

                <p>To use, you'll simply provide a portion of the URL (domain) you'd like to time your time on.</p>

                <p>
                  The intent of this extension was to be an annoyance to help get you (okay, me) off websites
                  that you (*I) spend a tad too much time on. But then I pondered, why stop at timing one site?

                <p><u>Steps to Use</u> (after installing):</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Click the extension's icon in the browser's toolbar.</li>
                  <li>On the pop-up page, enter the portion of a URL you would like to match and time.</li>
                  <li>Enter how long [in minutes] you would like to be on that site, before you are alerted (delay).</li>
                  <li>Enter how long [in minutes] you would like to continue being on that site after the initial timer has expired (snooze).</li>
                  <li>Click the Save button.</li>
                  <li>Note: The Alarm Type named "alerts" is a part of a future feature. That is, "alerts" is the only notification type available at this time.
                </ol>

                <p>
                  If you are already on a matched site when adding new URL info,
                  the timer will start immediately. If not, the timer will start
                  when you navigate to a URL that matches the partial URL entered.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <u>Side Note</u>: You can only have one "active" browser tab "active" at any one time,
                  ergo, you will only have one possible timer going at any given time.
                </p>

                <p><u>When a timer is active:</u></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>></b> So long as you stay on one tab,
                    and so long as you stay <b>within the same matched URL string</b>,
                    the timer will continue to count down <u>per that matched URL info's settings</u> (i.e. its delay and snooze settings).
                  </li>

                  <li><b>Navigating to another site, another tab, or closing another tab, will all affect (stop or restart) any active timer.</b></li>

                  <li><b>></b> When your preset number of minutes has expired, the browser will throw up an "Alert" dialog box.
                  More specifically, it's a "Confirm" dialog box, in which you can opt to 'snooze,' and continue browsing
                  the currently matched URL, or you can click OK to "end the madness!!"</li>

                The "disclaimer" would be that, at least for the initial versions of the app, <b>there can be various edge cases unaccounted for.</b>
                I did a LOT of testing, but there were multiple layered factors that went into various coding decision points.

                [2020-07-01 Update] - Some major bug fixes have helped with tab and app focus and navigation,
                with a mindset for only creating an alarm on 'an initial visit' of a 'matching and active page'.
                However, navigational bugs may still exist.

                The 'storage' that your URL info list is stored on is inside the browser and is only available if the browser supports the 'chrome.storage.sync' API.

                      The rules for this are as follows:
                    <ul>
                      <li>We're either going to open a new tab if only one tab is open.</li>
                      <li>Or, we'll switch to the first tab in the window if it is not already</li>
                      <li>the currently active tab, or the second tab if the first is active.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
